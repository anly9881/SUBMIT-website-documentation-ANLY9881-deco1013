      <h2>Website pages</h2>
      <p>I have developed 4 pages for the ASDOG website; Home, Make a difference, Services and a Contact us page. These will be introduced in this documentation website. </p>

      <h3 id="Home">Home</h3>
<p><strong/>Mock up: Home page</strong></p>
            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Landing page.png" alt="Home page" width="100%">
            </figure>

<p><strong/>Website: Home page</strong></p>
<figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Website/Screenshot 2020-11-29 105208.jpg" alt="Home page" width="100%">
            </figure>

            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Website/Screenshot 2020-11-29 105108.jpg" alt="Home page" width="100%">
            </figure>

      <p>I have asked for feedback in my designs with my website, popularly, the website design from the mockup looked too cluttered due to the black highlight and white text on top. This was an incurring pattern with the other pages of the website. When I was making the black highlight with the text, I thought it would create good contrast and layout with the text. So when developing the website, I took out the idea of this black highlight. </p>
<p>It is noticeably obvious that the mockup is different to the developed page. What I have done different here is that I have removed the side image from the mock up and replaced it with an image below the webpage. The "learn more" button was also removed due to limitations of pages made, however the button "Donate today" was functionally developed. I changed how the button looked like. The iteration of the button is introduced in another section in this website documentation. The left hand background box was also removed and the text margin was extended to go across the webpage to create more white space which makes it easier for reading the website. </p>

          <figure class="img-container">

            </figure>


<p><strong/>Website: Make a difference page</strong></p>
<figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Website/Screenshot 2020-11-29 105240.jpg" alt="Home page" width="100%">
            </figure>

            <figure class="img-container">

            </figure>

      <p>In this donations page I added in user inputs for them to enter their card details. It is one of the first few things on the webpage that the user would see and encourage them to donate more to the charity as a prompt. The "thank you" banner was removed from the mockup and was iterated into a sentence above the the user input.  </p>

      <p> To take advantge of the white space in the background, I added in relevant images that would have a positive connotation with the users to show that ASDOG is having a positive impact on the commnity and what their donations could go to. 
  
<h3 id="Services">Services</h3>

<p><strong/>Mock up: Services page</strong></p>

<p>His needs and requirements are to encourage others to help out in charities and define the importance of the support dogs in society. Futhermore he would like to express how much AUSDOG has changed his life with Bee and how he can help change the lives of others too through volunteering and donations. He would like donating to this charity to be more accessable and welcoming to others and feel more part of the organisation.</p>

      <h2>Ideation</h2>
      <p>The formation of the design is derived from different wesbites to make a layout that would seem to be the most fitting. Annotated websites are seen down below to show thought processors and sketches to show the result of what has been gathered. </p>

  <h2 id="Contents">Contents</h2>
      <h3 id="sitemap">Site map</h3>
      <p>To continue making a layout, an organised site map has been made to prepare what a website would need in it's site pages. Below is a sitemap made by Miro.</p>

<iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/o9J_khBvEYE=/?moveToViewport=-1298,-1288,2271,2093" frameBorder="0" scrolling="no" allowFullScreen></iframe>

      <h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
      <p>Layout and structure of the website is done through pencil and paper and revised through 2 iterations to improve design decisions. Under each sketch are annotations of design decisions towards why it has been made.</p>

          <p><strong/>Landing page 1</strong></p>
          <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Landing page 1.jpg" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>
<p> On a landing page it is important to show the user immediately what they are seeing. The media takes up more space on the website, which becomes salient. There would show AUSDOG's services, donations, stories, and such. This allows the user to quickly flip through and conveniently explore AUSDOG.</p>
<p>The goal of the website is to increase revenue from charity donations. The Donation link is placed on the bottom left below the media. IT has been placed there as users typically read from left to right and would see the donate icon immediately after seeing the cause of what AUSDOG works for in the media slider.</p>
<p>The two bottom right columns are introductory links for the user to learn more about AUSDOG without clicking on the links above for easy access.</p>
<p>Noticably, most websites have their logos situated on the top left and I have adopted that into this layout as users would typically be looking at the top left due to the placement being more uniform amongst websites.</p>
          <p><strong/>Landing page 2</strong></p>
          <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Landing page 2.jpg" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>
<p>Compared to landing page 1, this landing page is more populated with information. I have used a grid structure and tried to incorporate an "F" reading style which is typically how a user would scan a webpage. This is by having the 2 lines of the mission statement and a longer reading block for "About us" </p>
<p>I am being considerate with white space on the website. I purposefully made the middle of the webpage to be more spacious to separate the contributions box from the left-hand side of the page. Doing so would attract the user to focus on the left-hand side more where the donations box is situated. It becomes more eye-grabbing. Having the contributions page on the right to support it also gives more incentive to donate whereby users become more aware of what their money would go to and its value.  </p>
<p>I have changed the media box into a contributions box. I think that if the website focused more on what AUSDOG has contributed to society more so than marketing their services, it would reinforce the positivity and impact AUSDOG has which in turn would be an incentive for people to donate more rather than seeing its services as people looking for services would have a more direct aim in lodging an application for a support dog. </p>
<p>Social media is a great way to engage its' users to a website. It is highly popular in the digital age we live in. it is important to direct the user to a company's social media quickly and efficiently when a user is looking for it. I have included 3 boxes on top of the page where it can be easily located by the user along with a search bar. Namely Facebook and Instagram are used. The last box would be a donations box as a reassuring second link to remind the user if they would like to donate.  </p>
          <p><strong/>Landing page 3</strong></p>
          <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Landing page 3.jpg" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>
<p>I have adopted the structure of Landing page 2, however, I have incorporated bigger text boxes and changed the style shape of the tabs. I have rounded the tab shapes and the social media icons to match. I think it would make the tabs more noticeable to use, whereby the shape is very similar to what a normal browser tab looks like. Additionally, I have made spaces between each tab to easily identify each one.    </p>
<p>Because the text boxes take a lot of room, it leaves little space for a link to the donations page. It is then placed at the bottom right after seeing marketing/contribution ads. Which in turn is not very effective in placement as it would be the last link to see. Seeing this layout I am not that keen on using this structure.</p>

          <p><strong/>Landing page 4</strong></p>
          <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Landing page 4.jpg" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>
<p>Like the other landing page layouts, this layout uses a grid structure. It is important to introduce the company to the user, so the company name is largely placed on the top of the webpage and below it would be an introduction about AUSDOG. </p>

<p>The page options are on the left hand side where the user can easily scroll through what AUSDOG has to offer.  </p>
          <p><strong/>About us page</strong></p>
          <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/About us.jpg" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>

    <p>Introducing the company and its' mission statement is important as users would want instant information. This would also be shown on the landing page. In this wireframe, I have made it as a block text. I do not think it would be relevant to have other information on the page. We would want to immerse the user into knowing what AUSDOG provides and become more aware of its impact on society and be more inclined to donate. </p>

          <p><strong/>Donation page 1</strong></p>
          <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Donate Page.jpg" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>

            <p>This page solely focuses on what the user can do to make a difference and be part of the charity. The large box would state reasons why one would donate and the box beside it would be an icon to lead the user to a thank you page after they donate to AUSDOg. The smaller box on the bottom right would aid the reasons why the user should donate to this specific charity and would take them to the contributions page to see how they can also leave an impact. </p>

          <p><strong/>Donation page 2</strong></p>
          <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Thankyou.jpg" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>
<p>After clicking the link to donate on the donation page, they are taken to a thank you page to show company appreciation. It is important to recognise user effort and time to donate to this charity. The large box would be an image with an extended thank you strip. I have placed it this way as being connected would be an easier viewing flow from left to right. At the bottom of the strip is a text box to state what the donation can do and what has been currently achieved reassure the feeling that they have made a difference and have a more lasting positive impact. Either than the strip and this text box, there is no other text on this webpage, this is so it can focus on user appreciation. </p>

          <p><strong/>Contributions page</strong></p>
          <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/contributions page.jpg" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>

<p>The contributions page has an obvious grid structure and using white space for a more organised webpage and attracts the user to each square. Depending on how much the company would like to present, more squares would be used and can be scrolled down to view more media. On the right-hand side margin, I have decided to not place squares there and leave room for a donations section. This section is also noticeably bigger and would be on the side sight as the user browses through the square. This means the user is actively looking at the square without having the intention to. </p> 

<          <p><strong/>Services page</strong></p>
          <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Services.jpg" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>
<p>The left column explains more throughly the services AUSDOG can provide to the users in more detail and at the side there seperate boxes that show indiviual link the user can click on and find what they would be searching for more easier. I have chose 4 boxes as researching the company there would only 3 relevant services that individuals use which is adoptions, making applications for a support dog and volunteering services. The fourth box is left as a donations tab and text. </p>


          <p><strong/>Contact Us page</strong></p>
          <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Contact us.jpg" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>

<p> Following the structure of the other webpages, it follows a grid-like pattern. However, the website has more mixed information presented than focusing on the presented information. The contact information can still be easily accessed on the side, however, we still want to grab the user's attention to persuade users to donate to charity. Picture squares are used to make it more simplistic than text and a final square at the side to lead the user back to the donations page. The donations page can be reached in 2 ways; through the link and the tabs above the page. <p>

    </section>

    <section id="designs">
      <h2>Designs</h2>
      <p>After sketching potential pages, low fidelity wireframes have been made..</p>
      <h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>

<p><strong/>Landing page</strong></p>
            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Landing page W.png" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>

            <p>I have combined the landing pages 3 and 2 to make the wireframe. I have adopted the tab design from sketch 3 and the page layout of sketch 2.</p> 

            <p>I have chosen the layout from sketch 2 as it allows for more information to be presented clearly whilst holding the integrity of the information and most importantly featuring the donate link on the webpage in an attractive spot.</p>
            <p> I have chosen the tabs that look more separated rather than connected to make each tab stand out and make it easier for the user to navigate between pages. It is also similar looking to a normal browser tab, and so it can be easily identified. This tab design would be used in the rest of the web pages. </p>
            <p>The logos above the tab line are also changed to a circle shape rather than a square. This is to support the design of the rounded tab design and would give off a better aesthetic to the user.</p>
          <p> In the wireframe I have also shown what it would look like if a tab was hovered upon. A drop-down menu would ensue. I did not choose the have a sidebar menu as presented on landing page 4 as it would become more cluttered and disorganised due to the website have suboption categories and a collapse feature did not seem appropriate. </p>
 
            <p><strong/>About us</strong></p>
            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/About us W.png" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>

            <p> I have kept the wireframe very similar to the sketch. The design is neat and organised to present information and continues to have a donation link at the bottom right of the page for increased accessibility for the user to donate. 

            <p><strong/>Donations</strong></p>
            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Donations W.png" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>

            <p>This wireframe is the page that gives incentives for individuals to donate. It would show the positive impacts AUSDOG has provided to the community through charity and what the user's donations can impact on other people. This page solely focuses on this aspect and I have not decided to add anything to it and keep other information as separate as possible to not distract the user.</p> 
            <p>The connected layout of this design is still used like in the sketch. Placing this in a wireframe gives a good representation of how a user would scan the page. </p> 

 <p><strong/>Donations - Thank you</strong></p>
            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Donations thank you W.png" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>

            <p> I have kept the integrity of the donations page from the sketch however I have changed the arrow into a box instead to make it more obvious to the user that they would be able to learn more about where their dollar can go to. This would link them to the contributions page. </p>

<p><strong/>Contributions</strong></p>
            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Contributions W.png" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>

            <p> The contributions page is a support webpage to aid the reasons why a user should donate. Showing positive impacts AUSDOG has on the community gives an awareness the user would also be able to make a difference. In the research made. It has been researched positive images and stories would associate the sense of charity and generosity which heightens a person's willingness to donate. Conversely, if negative images were shown to evoke strong empathy it would destimulate the feeling of generosity and would evoke a sense of helplessness that they are not able to change the current situation. Thus having a compilation of stories and or images linked on one page would give reasoning a person should donate to AUSDOG.</p>

<p><strong/>Services</strong></p>
            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Services W.png" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>

            <p> I have substitutes the arrows to boxes on the below right to increase the appearance of the links. I have also made the white space between each box larger than planned. I think it would bring a more unequal balance between the left and right of the screen to divert the user's attention more. </p> 

            <p><strong/>Contact us</strong></p>
            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Services W.png" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>
<p> The contact us page is more versatile than the rest of the designed web pages. It incoorpaerates different information. I have made the donation link larger and in a circle shape, which is more distinguishable than the rectangles. This attention would make users more inclined to press the link. 


            <p><strong/>Tabs</strong></p>
            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Tab on pages.png" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>

            <p><strong/>Tabs</strong></p>
            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/tab design.jpg" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>
The tab design on the pages are different when a page is clicked. When a tab is pressed, it heigtens up to become more obvious what page the user is on. See above for refference. 

      <h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>
      <p>After making the wireframes, we have a better idea of how the layout and structure of the website would look. Mockups are made to express this. In the webpage layouts, I have used a classic black and white theme. I believe that this would make the grid structure better presented using opposite shades and have made black stroke frames around images to make it more distinguished. </p>

    <p>Additionally what is kept the same throughout the webpage, are the social media icons, logo, and tabs.

<p><strong/>Landing page</strong></p>
            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Landing page.png" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>

        <p>With the monotone colour palette, the images become more prominent. Knowing so, the donation link would feature an image behind it to make it more attractive. Text is also used in the colour black or white, with some parts highlighted to show key points. </p>

</p> The contributions media is also prominent on the screen with a learn more feature situated on the bottom right. This is so the viewer is more concentrated on the image rather than seeing a link to another page. They would naturally look to the bottom right to see the learn more feature when they read in a top to down approach.  </p> 

<p><strong/>About us</strong></p>
            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/About us.png" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>
<p> Slightly difference to the wireframe. Instead on 2 rows at the top, I have changed it to one heading to make it look more salient. The mission statement has already been made in the landing page. </p>

<p> The donations link has also been changed to the bottom right rather than the top left to make the website more organsied as the overlap in text makes it look messy and random. <p> 


<p><strong/>Make a difference</strong></p>
            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Donations.png" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>

            The words "Make a difference" are used throughout the webpages. It is a call to action verb to influence users to contribute to charity with AUSDOG. The same image of the golden retriever is used through different webpages for a more memorable experience. 

<p><strong/>Make a difference - Thank you page</strong></p>
            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Thankyou.png" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>

            Using the same image, form the donation link, it is enlarged on the page. A black trip is extended from the image for easier user reading flow with limited caps. 

<p><strong/>Services</strong></p>
            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Services.png" alt="Random function" width="100%">
            </figure>

            <p>Most of this mockup remains true to the wireframe, however, I have included black highlights and white text to the bottom right of each image. This makes it easier for the user to understand what each box represents and navigate quicker than guessing what each link takes them. </p>

            <p><strong/>Contributions</strong></p>
            <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="Images/Contributions.png" alt="Random function" width="100%">

<p> White spacing between the images are even horizontally this makes the links more indipendant from each other. The white spaces are more closer together vertically for the user to scroll down the page faster and more conveniently.

            <p>This webpage is on the last tab of the navigation panel. It has been designed like this as users would more likely want to contact them last after learning what AUSDOG is and what they have to offer to the community as a charitable company.</p>

            <p> The contact page is seperated in 3 parts </p>
            <li>Contact information</li>
            <li>images</li>
            <li>donation link</li>

            <p>It is important to refer the user back to the donations page when possible to attract more funds. </p>

<p> The reason why I changed how the button looked like was due to aesthetic purposes and accessibility to the donation page. People would be confused whether they would be seeing an image or a link and would limit the reasonsing to press the button. I think it would be more clear to the users to make a donation with the button being very obvious that it is a link that goes to another page. As we can see the above, it is more direct with the button with the black boarder and brings a more obvious statement for a call to action. Iterations on this button is made.
